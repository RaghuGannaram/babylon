                <p>
                    Inspired by the ancient city of Babylon, a hub of knowledge and culture, we envisioned a platform
                    that celebrates the art of storytelling through cinema. With a passion for films and the goal of
                    making movie knowledge accessible to everyone, Babylon was born as a tribute to the world of
                    movies.
